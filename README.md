# crx-live-translate
Chrome/Edge extension to recognize any live audio/video streaming then translate it for free

Just clone or download this git then enable Chrome Developer Mode and install this extension by Load Unpacked and choose that cloned folder (folder that has manifest.json on it)

You need to install CORS Unblock Chrome extension before install this extension to avoid default CORS Blocking Policy of Chrome and Edge

You will also need Stereo Mix or Virtual Audio Cable recording device for best recognizing

I just tested this on Edge and Chrome only
